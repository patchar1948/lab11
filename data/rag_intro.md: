Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information
retrieval with text generation. A retriever searches a document store using embeddings, and the generator uses the retrieved passages as context to produce grounded answers. Key hyperparameters include chunk size, overlap, k results, and a similarity threshold.
